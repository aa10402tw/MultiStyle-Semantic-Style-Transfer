# MultiStyle Sematic Style Transfer
This project is aimed to transfer different sematic objects in one image into different style.

- [x] On-line Image Optimization
- [ ] MRF-based blending
- [ ] Off-line Model optimization
- [ ] Video style tranfer

In 1D visualization, the red/blue line are representing the Probability Density Function for data generating from real/generator. <br>
And the dot line are the output for discriminator, where the higher value mean the discriminator believes the data is from real distribution more. <br>


### 2D visualization

In 2D visualization, the red/blue dots are the data points generating from real/generator. <br>
And the contour line are the output for discriminator, where the higher value mean the discriminator believes the data is from real distribution more. <br> -->
